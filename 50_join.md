1.  [Join the MeetUp][meetup] so that you can RSVP to club-nights.
2.  Attend a club-night and play some games!
3.  Once at the club, join our Discord (details at venue) to keep up-to date!


## Club Nights
We meet weekly but the night and the venue changes depending on the time of
year. Currently our summer venue is The Commons, while Crux Fermentation Project hosts us the rest of the year. In rare cases a club-night is cancelled and non-members should check
[the MeetUp][meetup] to confirm that the event is still on. Club-members
will get notified via Discord and/or email.


### What to expect
Boards, pieces &amp; clocks are provided! Look for others, introduce yourself
and challenge someone to a game! It's a no-pressure, unrated, relaxed meetup
where you can sit down and play anyone. Food & drink is usually accessible
either through local vendors or the venue itself.


## Quads
Please speak to Dean about joining [Quads](/quads/). There is a sign-up sheet
available for members on club-nights. (Note that we recommend that only active
members sign-up for Quads.)


### FAQ
<dl>
    <dt>Are Children welcome?<dt>
    <dd>While the club is primarily aimed at adults, juniors are always welcome! Parents should be aware that the average age at the club is probably around 30, and that on most (but not all) nights their child may be the youngest player. In practice, young people do really well here when they aren't daunted by adults. Everyone just wants to play, and its always a joy to see young people exploring the game. Young people can and have thrived here - its a wholesome and fun atmosphere. But this is a competitive club, and competition is fierce!</dd>
    <dt>Do I need to play Chess or Go already in order to attend the club? </dt>
    <dd>Players of all skill-levels are welcome. If you're completely new to the game then it is worth doing some preparation before you come. For Chess, try the <a href="https://lichess.org/learn">lichess.org/learn</a> pages. For Go, we recommend the <a href="https://way-to-go.gitlab.io/">Interactive Way to Go</a>.</dd>
    <dt>I’m a beginner, are there other players at my skill-level?</dt>
    <dd>Beginners are rarely alone at the club! However, playing club-level Chess & Go makes people stronger over time. As a beginner you can expect to feel like club-level play has a steep learning curve, but you will find the atmosphere welcoming and, once you get a few wins under your belt, rather competitive too!</dd>
    <dt>Other chess clubs that I’ve been to have been set up for serious games that take hours, is the club going to be like that? </dt>
    <dd>Nope! We strive to have a casual and supportive atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable popping in for a game or two. Expect to hear some friendly banter about the latest swindle that was just pulled off alongside discussions of what the newest stockfish recommends in the main line of the fantasy variation of the Caro-Kann. While we do host competitive games through the <a href="/quads/">Quads</a> most games played at the club are casual and a long Chess game may take ~25 minutes.
</dd>
    <dt>Do I need to bring anything? </dt>
    <dd>The club provides boards & clocks. For Chess, we usually have plenty of equipment (but bring you're own if you have a strong preference.) Go equipment is more sparse and we can run out of Go boards on busy nights (also, a byo-yomi clock always helps!)</dd>
    <dt>How do I find someone to play? </dt>
    <dd>You are welcome to challenge anyone who isn’t currently playing a game. The more people you challenge, the better time you will have! If you’re unsure about who to ask, please reach out to a club member wearing a lanyard, who should be able to help assess your skills and pair you with someone close to your skill level. 
    </dd>
    <dt>I’ve never played with a clock before, is that required? </dt>
    <dd>Playing with a clock isn’t required, but is encouraged! Don't worry about clocks - just ask your first opponent to show you how it works and they'll feel natural already by the end of the evening. For complete beginners we understand that clocks aren't appropriate - again, there's no need to worry. Most regular members play games with clocks and once you get a handle on the basics it will seem quite natural. Timed games promote a competitive atmosphere and are good practice for competition. If you decide to join <a href="/quads/">Quads</a>, then Chess games play 10m+5s and Go games play 3m+10s or 5m+5x30s.</dd>
    <dt>Is it okay to eat or drink while playing? </dt>
    <dd>Certainly, we rely on our hosts to allow the club to run, and buying a drink or some food is a great way to thank them and help support the club's future. 
    </dd>
    <dt>What do I do after I finish a game? </dt>
    <dd>You are welcome and encouraged to do some analysis of the game with your opponent. Rematches usually switch colors for chess, or you can find another opponent. The more people you challenge, the better time you will have!</dd>
    <dt>What are Quads? </dt>
    <dd>We host a monthly competition that regular members participate in throughout the month. Most games played at the club are casual, but often you will see a *Quad Game* sign next to a board - that game is part of the competition, so we try not to disturb them. If you'd like to learn more, check out the <a href="/quads/">Quads</a> page or ask when you visit the club!</dd>
    <dt>Do you change venues?</dt>
    <dd>Yes, our winter venue, Crux, hosts us for most of the year. Our summer venue, The Commons, hosts us for casual play from July-September.</dd>
