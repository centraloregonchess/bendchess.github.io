### FAQ's
<dl>
    <dt>Do I need to know how to play chess or go in order to come to the club? </dt>
    <dd></dd> Nope! While it is helpful to know a little bit about the basics of the game, we have experienced players willing to help out new players who are just starting their chess or go journey.
</dd>
    <dt>I’m a beginner, are there going to be other players there of my skill level? </dt>
    <dd</dd> On most nights we have players ranging from 700-2250 chess.com rapid rating, and from 13 kyu to 1 dan go ratings. If there isn’t anyone close to your skill level, feel free to ask one of the higher rated players for a teaching game. 
</dd>
    <dt>Other chess clubs that I’ve been to have been set up for serious games that take hours, is the club going to be like that? </dt>
    <dd></dd> Nope, we strive to have a casual and supportive atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable popping in for a game or two. Expect to hear some friendly banter about the latest swindle that was just pulled off alongside discussions of what the newest stockfish recommends in the main line of the fantasy variation of the Caro-Kann. While we do host competitive games through the Quad’s system, most games played at the club are purely for fun.
</dd>
    <dt>Do I need to bring anything? </dt>
    <dd></dd>If you’d like to bring your own board and pieces you are welcome to, but we usually have plenty of sets for general use.
    </dd>
    <dt>How do I find someone to play? </dt>
    <dd>You are welcome to challenge anyone who isn’t currently playing a game. If you’re unsure about who to ask, please reach out to someone wearing a lanyard who should be able to help assess your skills and pair you with someone close to your skill level. 
    </dd>
    <dt>I’ve never played with a clock before, is that required? </dt>
    <dd></dd> Playing with a clock isn’t required, but is encouraged. Timed games help players get more games in with different opponents, and is the standard for most casual and competitive chess. The standard time control for chess is 10 minutes with a 5 second increment, and go is 3 minutes with a 10 second increment. However, if you would like to play faster time controls (yay blitz and bullet!) please feel free to adjust the clocks (ask someone with a lanyard if you are unsure how).
</dd>
    <dt>Is it okay to eat or drink while playing? </dt>
    <dd></dd>Certainly, we are graciously hosted by Crux or the Commons, and buying a drink or some food is a great way to thank them and keep the club in their good graces. 
    </dd>
    <dt>What do I do after I finish a game? </dt>
    <dd></dd>You are welcome and encouraged to do some analysis of the game with your opponent. Rematches usually switch colors for chess, or you can find another opponent.
    </dd>
    <dt>What are Quads? </dt>
    <dd></dd>Please see the Quads page for more details. If a game has a “Quad Game” sign next to it, please don’t disturb the players while they are playing. If you are interested in joining Quad’s, please speak to Dean.
