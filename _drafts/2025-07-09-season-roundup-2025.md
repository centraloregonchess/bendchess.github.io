2025 saw Bend Chess & Go Club's strongest field yet! A huge surge in strength made every Quad a battle as **300+ games were played between the 28 players** who completed the season!

For the first time in 2025 Quad-Season ran from January-thru-June instead of the previous 12-month cycles. This lead to an intense race for the title as the shorter 6-month cycle made every result count!

As **we move to our Summer venue [The Commons Cafe & Taproom](/about/#the-venues)**, the club can relax until October for the Summer's Off-Season games. This year especially, though, we can **look back at our Winter venue, [Crux](/about/#the-venues)**, with gratitude for making our 2025 Quad-Season such a success!

### Chess Awards

#### 📈 Most Improved Player: Mike S

Since joining the 5th Quad in February 2023, Mike S has often walked a line between the beginners and intermediates at the Club making him a common first-opponent for new-commers to the club. 2025 started with the club’s strongest ever field and this bode-poorly for Mike, who’s 2024 results had suffered as the club got stronger. Mike reversed the trend convincingly with a \+133 surge in elo\! Mike went from January’s 1124 to a personal-best with June’s 1257\! Throughout the season Mike continuously posted steady results and his 5/6 score in March secured a spot in the 3rd Quad. From there Mike’s performance ratings held-high as each month he saw off new challenges. Mike S even finished the season by winning the 3rd Quad in June\!


#### 🥊 Rock Solid: Thomas F

Thomas F might not always have the highest scores, but he has been the model of consistency in the 3rd Quad, staying in there for the entirety of the tournament. He managed to hold his own in quads with much higher and lower rated players, and showed a fighting spirit that kept higher seeds on their toes. He’s the kind of competitor no one can underestimate.


#### 🔥 Hottest Streak: Zach C

Zach C’s results might seem moderate at first glance, but look closer and you’ll see an impressive hot streak in June. After modest results earlier in the season, he erupted with 5/6 in June’s Championship Quad, achieving a performance rating of **2188**, his best of the year. This was a stunning leap and shows how momentum can shift in chess. Zach’s powerful finish hints at even greater things to come.


#### 🎯 Consistency Award: Joey S

Joey S delivered remarkably steady performances across the season, scoring between **10 and 15 Grand Prix points every month**. Joey kept racking up solid results in both Championship & Challenger Quads, even when facing higher-rated opposition. His average Elo stayed in the **1900s**, and had the lowest standard deviation of performance rating of 59.7, the lowest in the club by a significant margin\! His unorthodox style (who cares about king safety?), seems to perform similarly well against a wide range of players. 


#### 🎯 Rollercoaster Award: Daniel B

Daniel B had the highest standard deviation of performance ratings of any of the full time players, with a deviation of over 200 ELO per month\! After Blake S’s 6/6 in the January Championship, Daniel looked to mount a valiant defense of his 2024 Champion title and delivered a shocking performance rating of 2183, scoring 5/6 in the February Championship Quad\! The battle with Blake S was short-lived, though \- Daniel never reproduced his February performance and (after a March score of 1.5/6) Daniel was demoted to the Challenger Quad. Daniel’s title hopes were dashed when promotion kept eluding him, proving that not even a Champion was assured victory in the Challenger Quad this year\!.


#### 🎯 Best Top Quad Performance: Zach C in June

With a single month performance of 5/6 in the top quad, Zach’s June performance rating of 2188 barely beats out Daniel B’s 2183 for his 5/6 in February, and Blake S’s 6/6 for 2183 in January. It was the highest single-month performance rating of the entire season and showcased his potential to dominate even the toughest fields. Zach’s June performance was the payoff for a season-long study of his opponent’s. Zach’s preparation is notorious amongst the top-players but it was his ability to rise to the challenge posed by new-comer Blake S that set him apart. Zach proved that he’s ready to fight for the title and the other top-players will have to be ready for him next season\!  


#### 🎯 Best Lower Quad Performance: Joe M in May

With a single month performance of 3.5/4 in the fifth quad, Joe M’s performance rating of 1375 was over 240 points higher than his rating\! Joe M is one of the few Go players at the club who still competes on the Chess-side. He isn’t trying to push his Chess but among the lower-quads is clearly a dangerous force\! His aggressive play can catch-out anyone and he keeps proving that he knows how to win games\!


#### 🎭 Spirit of the Quads Award: Loren S

Loren S may not have scored the highest, but they competed almost every month and played **35 games** across the season. Their perseverance and enthusiasm are contagious, embodying what makes club chess so special.

### Go Awards

#### 📈 Most Improved Player: Joe M

Joe takes the Most Improved Player award for his climb from 12k to 10k on the back of two 6/8 seasons. Joe joined the Go side of the club having never played the game before in late 2023, and is now on the verge of joining the top SDK quad, which is all the more impressive given that our closed pool of talent makes gaining rank more difficult than usual. Joe always brings a fighting spirit to his games, and an increasing ability to read out sequences over the board is turning that into wins.


#### 🎭 Spirit of the Quads Award: Tommy I

While struggling a bit in his quad games, particularly in the first half of the season, Tommy has nonetheless shown up every week and continued to play. His 44 Grand Prix points over the first half of the year are the most for any Go player. For his tenacity in the face of adversity and constant presence, Tommy wins the Go Spirit of the Quads Award.


### Grand-Prix Winners
<img class="page-context-right" title="2025's Grand-Prix Winners" alt="Zach C, Joe M, Sophie S & Tommy I with their Grand-Prix Mugs" src="/assets/images/photos/2025-07-grand-prix-winners.jpg">
The Grand-Prix rewards players who play games & score points. Scoring well means
not only that you're active in the club, but that you are also winning games.
Grand-Prix leaders tend to be the club's pace-setters, as their high-scoring
results often decide the Quads they play in while their steady presence sets
the Club's tone. The prize, awarded every three months, is a winning tie-break
until the next Grand-Prix. Tie-breaks such as head-to-head score or
games-played may not be enough to decide a four-person Quad, and the 2025
season saw the Grand-Prix results (and it's tie-breaking role) becoming more
important than ever!

## Player Profiles

### Chess Players

#### ♟️ Blake S (Club Chess Champion)

<img class="page-context-right" title="Chess Championship race 2025" alt="A graph showing the 2025 Chess Championship race" src="/assets/images/photos/2025-07-championship-race.jpg">
Blake’s mid-2024 entry into the Quads nearly up-turned last-year’s title race as he immediately began swatting the top-players aside. Blake S brings humour & fun to the board \- a useful trait as he helps each opponent laugh-off their defeat\! Blake’s enthusiasm for the game (along with his fierce competitiveness) was always going to be welcome at the Club. It's his universal-style & superior strength, however, that made him the unambiguous favourite for the 2025 title \- a race Blake started with a perfect 6/6 in January’s Championship Quad. Blake required each of his opponents to find their own solution to his Lasker-like dynamism and to their credit, far from being anointed Champion with consecutive victories, Blake S was forced to adapt & fight in what became a season-long campaign in the struggle for points. Daniel B, the 2024 Champion, was the first to assert himself when he held Blake 1-for-1 and won the February Quad with 5/6. Blake’s 2nd win in March with 4/6 gave him a vital 5-point lead over Zach C but dropping points to both rivals had given them hope. After Zach C closed the gap by taking April it made Blake’s May’s ½ point victory with 2.5/4 the crucial result that secured Blake the title. Blake has set the standard not just for strength but for competitive spirit \- two qualities that any Club can be grateful for in a worthy Chess Champion\!

| Start Rating | Final Rating | Rating Change | Average Perf. | Score | Games | Record | Champ Points |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 2018? | 1994 | \-24 | 1997 | 22.5 | 34 | 66.18% | 23 |


#### ♟️ Zach C (Club Deputy & Web Officer)

Zach C’s 2024 rivalry with Daniel B was interrupted with the arrival of Blake S and Joey S in the top-Quads. No longer assured of a spot at the top, preparation and self-reinvention allowed Zach not just to survive but also to push for the Championship title. Winter showed solid but quiet results as Zach weathered Daniel B & Blake S’s assaults, but by March Zach’s transformation from a risk-taking gambiteer into a measured (yet ferocious) positional player was gaining traction. Zach took 1.5 points from Daniel and held 1-for-1 against the new-comers to send his 2024 rival down & out of the race. April saw the Quad go to tie-breaks and Blake’s lead in the Championship was reduced to just two-points\! Perhaps the pressure took its toll, as Zach was unable to muster the results he needed in May. Going into June, Zach needed not only to win the Championship Quad \- he also needed Blake to be relegated\! Zach did all he could and finished out with his season-best performance rating of 2188, scoring 5/6 \- and finishing just 3 points behind Blake’s total. Zach C’s resilience at the top is unmatched \- he is the only player at the top to have gained rating points this season; the only player from 2024 to maintain his spot in the Championship Quad, and now; the only player to twice come 2nd in the Championship title race\!

| Start Rating | Final Rating | Rating Change | Average Perf. | Score | Games | Record | Champ Points |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1853 | 1928 | \+75 | 1949 | 18.5 | 34 | 54.41% | 20 |


#### ♟️ Joey S

Few players were as consistent as Joey S. He battled in both Championship and Challenger quads, usually racking up **10–15 Grand Prix points each month**. His Elo stayed fairly stable in the **1900s**, a sign of both strong play and reliability. Perhaps the most unorthodox player at the club, Joey eschews standard principled play for positions that he feels comfortable in, and very often turns what seem to be extremely uncomfortable positions to play into deadly counterstrikes that leave his opponents scratching their heads as to how they spoiled that position. Not many players would dare bongcloud in quads, let alone a double bongcloud\! However, despite his seemingly wild play, Joey’s results showed his class. He never dipped too low nor spiked too wildly—he’s a rock-solid competitor and a crucial anchor in the top quads. A future season winner if he puts together a breakout month or two

| Start Rating | Final Rating | Rating Change | Average Perf. | Score | Games | Record | Champ Points |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 2000? | 1879 | \-121 | 1889 | 18 | 32 | 56.25% | 15 |


#### ♟️ Daniel B (Club Deputy & TD)

Our defending Club Chess Champion, Daniel B, had a season of two halves. January through March was a title-defense but it was Blake S who set the pace, leaving Daniel to chase Blake’s 6/6 from January. Daniel wasted no time & struck back in February, taking two points from Blake and winning the Quad with a dominant 5/6. March saw another big test as Joey S (another strong new-comer) rose to the Championship. Ultimately, Daniel B was squeezed out after scoring a battle-weary 1.5/6 and his title-defense seemed almost over. The second-half of the season saw Daniel B fighting for promotion from the Challenger Quad but each month somehow the promotion eluded him. In April, Daniel dropped 2 points to a meteoric Andrew M. Leaving May as Daniel’s last chance to rejoin the race. Ultimately, Daniel was unable to take control of the Quad and gave Dean C the spot on tie-breaks. The disappointing results don’t tell the whole story, and Daniel maintains one of the highest average performance ratings at the club. No doubt we’ll see Daniel B contending for the Championship title again next season.

| Start Rating | Final Rating | Rating Change | Average Perf. | Score | Games | Record | Champ Points |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1867 | 1856 | \-11 | 1881 | 16.5 | 31 | 53.23% | 14 |


#### ♟️ Dean C (Chess Captain)

Bend Chess & Go Club’s Chess Captain, Dean C, was a quiet but persistent force throughout the 2025 season. He hovered between the Championship & Challenger quads and managed solid results each month, with performance ratings often exceeding his end-of-month Elo. Dean is one of those players who rarely gets blown off the board—even in tough quads. A strongly principled player, Dean almost never lets himself get into positions with long term weaknesses, and instead forces his opponent to find some breakthrough before he grinds their position into bits. However, his predilection towards calculation and a subsequent propensity for low time has prevented him from regaining the mastery over the quads that he previously enjoyed. However, Dean’s been practicing his blitz skills, and if he can retain the same form he shows with 8 minutes on the clock as with 30 seconds, he’ll be a perennial title challenger. Dean finished the season in the Championship Quad, showing once again that he belongs among the top-tier of the club. 

| Start Rating | Final Rating | Rating Change | Average Perf. | Score | Games | Record | Champ Points |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1811 | 1821 | \+10 | 1852 | 17.5 | 33 | 53.03% | 10 |


#### ♟️ Andrew M

Andrew M, a longtime stalwart amongst the club’s top-flight, set out to break-the-mold of “not quite winning” which had defined his 2024 season. A promising start saw him winning the Challenger Quad in January but fell back down after struggling to score in the Championship. Andrew started March with a strong ¾ but was unable to finish the job. April saw Andrew facing newly relegated Daniel B \- both players had to fight to revive their championship chances. Andrew promptly took the full 2-points from Daniel and won the Quad with a convincing 4.5/6  and his best performance rating of the year. Unfortunately, a racing injury put a sudden halt to Andrew’s season and we’re all wishing him a speedy recovery.

| Start Rating | Final Rating | Rating Change | Average Perf. | Score | Games | Record | Champ Points |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1823 | 1833 | \+10 | 1839 | 14 | 24 | 58.33% | 8 |


#### ♟️ Luca P (Club Deputy)

Luca P’s meteoric rise in 2024 meant that he was one to watch this season \- 2025 started with a stronger field and Luca suddenly needed to fight to maintain position in the top-Quads. Now the Challengers required Luca to face local-rival Devin V to avoid relegation. Despite taking points from Devin in both February and April, Luca P struggled to match Devin’s score against the other players. Glimpses of Luca’s previous dominance were seen anytime he was relegated. The 3rd Quad couldn’t cope with Luca and March saw him peaking with a perfect **6/6** with a performance rating of **1696**. Luca P is a principled player who is willing to take risks when the position calls for it. Lately, many of those risks haven’t worked out. The rivalry with Devin V is by no means over but Luca P will want to have answers to Devin’s consistency before 2026 gets underway\! 

| Start Rating | Final Rating | Rating Change | Average Perf. | Score | Games | Record | Champ Points |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1708 | 1665 | \-43 | 1620 | 17.5 | 36 | 48.61% | 6 |


#### ♟️ Devin V

Devin V exemplifies quiet growth. He started at **1631 Elo in January** and finished June at **1713**—a terrific **\+82 point gain**. Devin’s average performance of 1785 is vindication of a deliberate attempt to minimize risk and to trust that even the strongest opponents will give him a chance to win. In January, it wasn’t Zach or Daniel that gave Blake, the strongest player at the club, his hardest games of the month, it was Devin\! Forcing Blake to convert an objectively equal bishop endgame under time pressure was more than anyone else could manage that month. It wasn’t enough to keep him in the Championship Quad in January but the Challengers was a different story. Every month Devin has taken points from 1800+ rated players. This secured his spot in the Challenger Quad, taking 2 points from Dean C in February and another in March. Luca P was a constant threat but couldn’t compete with Devin’s results which speak of huge growth over the season, even as the strength of the top-quads grew.

| Start Rating | Final Rating | Rating Change | Average Perf. | Score | Games | Record | Champ Points |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1631 | 1731 | \+100 | 1785 | 12 | 29 | 41.38% | 6 |


#### ♟️ Loren S (Club Deputy)

Loren S was one of the busiest players, logging **35 games** across the season. Though her scores were often modest, she’s the embodiment of fighting spirit. She finished June with a respectable **2/4 in the 5th Quad**, and ended around **1080 Elo**. Loren’s arrival has challenged Max S’ reputation as the fastest player at the club, a title that needs more time to be decided\!  Loren S has made her mark on the club since joining in December and we’re all thrilled that she has joined the Club’s team of Deputies.

| Start Rating | Final Rating | Rating Change | Average Perf. | Score | Games | Record | Champ Points |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1100? | 1062 | \-38 | 1006 | 12.5 | 35 | 35.71% | 5 |


#### ♟️ Chris H

Chris H, the Madras Club Captain, had a season of ebbs and flows. He posted a **1580 performance rating in April** and, much like Luca P, found himself going back-and-forth between the Challenger and 3rd Quads. This led to an unusual case where despite Luca P becoming Chris’ main rival they were never paired together in the same Quad\! Chris’s Elo rose slightly from **1623 in January to 1657 in June**. Though not among the highest scorers, Chris’s persistence and flashes of strength—like his **5/6 in April**—make him a dangerous opponent in any quad.

| Start Rating | Final Rating | Rating Change | Average Perf. | Score | Games | Record | Champ Points |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1588? | 1657 | \+69 | 1648 | 16 | 29 | 55.17% | 5 |


#### ♟️ Mike S

Mike S is the “hidden gem” of the season. Competing mostly in the 3rd & 4th Quads, he put together some great runs, such as **5/6 in March (4th Quad)** and steady play across multiple months. Winning in March put Mike into the 3rd Quad alongside his son Max S. Despite dropping 2 points to Max, Mike took the fight to Chris H, the strong Madras Club Captain, and won the point needed to stay-up. A feat he repeated in May against the strong new-comer Zech Z. Mike’s Elo ended around **1250**, but his performance ratings were often well above that. Mike’s upward trend shows he’s one to watch for higher quads in future seasons.

| Start Rating | Final Rating | Rating Change | Average Perf. | Score | Games | Record | Champ Points |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1124 | 1257 | \+133 | 1414 | 16 | 32 | 50.00% | 5 |


#### ♟️ Max S

Max S had a lively season. He bounced between 3rd & 4th Quads, producing respectable scores like **4/6 in March** and a **1592 performance rating**. Despite a couple of tough months, Max held his own and sits around **1280 Elo**. He’s a great example of a player developing through competitive games. He was unlucky not to stay in the 3rd Quad in May (after losing on tie-break) but Max is clearly outperforming his 2024 results. Max’s performance ratings suggest that he is currently under-rated, and it may take the Summer to reveal just how far his Chess has come.

| Start Rating | Final Rating | Rating Change | Average Perf. | Score | Games | Record | Champ Points |

| 1161 | 1287 | \+126 | 1295 | 13 | 26 | 50.00% | 5 |


#### ♟️ Joe M

Joe M played in the 4th & 5th Quads, with variable results. His **4/5 in April** was a high point, showing he’s capable of strong performances. He ended the half-year with an Elo around **1135–1157**. A long-serving Quad player, Joe has even been at the Club long enough to become stronger at Go than he was at Chess. But Joe’s Chess hasn’t languished;Joe is another lower-quad player whose best games hint at great potential and his aggressive style promises many fierce battles to come.

| 1138 | 1126 | \-12 | 1191 | 12 | 27 | 44.44% | 4 |


#### ♟️ Brian M

Brian M’s season was steady in the 4th & 5th Quads. He never posted a huge score, but played reliably throughout the season. His best month was March, scoring 3.5/8 for 15.5 Grand Prix points. He’s the kind of solid competitor who makes lower quads competitive and while maintaining good humour and charm throughout. The lower-quads have suffered over the years and it was Brian who (after an especially fun month in the bottom-Quad) suggested adding more people to more of the lower-quads. This change has led to more games being played and more opponents being found \- well done\!

| 1233? | 1238? | \+5 | 1253 | 16 | 27 | 59.26% | 4 |


#### ♟️ Sophie S

Sophie S played mostly in the 5th Quad, showing slow but steady growth. She achieved a **14.5 Grand Prix point performance in April**—her best month. While her Elo remained in the **900–1000 range**, her persistence and solid scores gained her the Spring Grand Prix, and her consistency and growing level of play bode well for the future. Sophie and her colleagues in the 5th Quad are all improving together which makes progress hard to see in the results, despite the clear increase in quality showing over-the-board.

#### ♟️ Thomas F

Thomas F has been a steady presence at the club for some years. This season he has settled into a relaxed pace and seems to be enjoying holding his spot in the 3rd Quad. That’s not nothing, the competition at the top has sent a flurry of 1700+ players down and Thomas has calmly fended off pressure from both above and below. Whatever Thomas F is doing it seems to be working, often surprising higher-rated opponents \- this can be seen in the numbers. Thomas’s 2/5 score in May, for example, required a performance rating of 1505 \- it was his win against new-comer Cedar M (rated 1633\) that made the difference. Perhaps Thomas’s best performance was taking the full 2-points from rival Jeff G (rated 1448\) in January. This was enough to stay in the 3rd Quad, a trend which Thomas was able to continue.

#### ♟️ Zech Z

Zech Z joined the 4th Quad in April and promptly won the Quad with 3.5/6. The 3rd Quad posed a new challenge as he faced Luca P (rated 1693\) who was freshly relegated and fighting for promotion. Zech was the only player to take a point from Luca P that month, demonstrating that he had what it takes to compete in the Challengers. His Elo ended at **1427** in June, showing a steady presence when active.

#### ♟️ Julian T

Julian T was one of the clubs most active members during the 2023 season, when he was beginning to hold his own in the middle-quads. His 2025 season gained momentum in March with a convincing 4.5/6 in the 4th Quad. Usually that would be enough to win but Julian was unable to play Mike S who took the Quad with 5/6. Julian had significantly out-rated his opponents up to that point but found himself 3rd seed in the 4th Quad in April. Julian managed to hold 2nd place with a 2/4 score but never found his rhythm and his season finished quietly. Julian has weathered many changes at the club and no doubt some regular play will see him score well in the 2026 season.

#### ♟️ Cedar M

Cedar M joined late in the season but has already held a performance rating in the **1500–1600s**. Their few games show solid fundamentals. Cedar’s profile suggests a player who could quickly climb with more activity.

#### ♟️ Adam Z

Adam Z joined the 5th Quad in April and quickly established himself as the newcomer-to-beat among the lower-quads. He won April with a convincing 4/5 but was unable to keep that momentum going throughout the season. Adam’s record or 75% after 8 games shows that it's too early to predict where Adam will place overall.

#### ♟️ Weston L

Weston’s principled opening & middle-game play keeps serving him well. Despite being new to Chess, diligent attention to the principles and an eagerness to attack has allowed Weston to thrive in the 5th Quad. Of course some of Weston’s attacks end disastrously but he manages to make them fun \- his good humor has meant that there’s been much more laughter at the club this season\! Weston began putting points on the board towards the end of the season \- a clear sign that Weston has succeeded in improving his over-the-board play.

### Go Players

#### ⚫ Carlin K (Go Champion & Club Deputy)

In addition to his role teaching strategy and reviewing games for the DDK players, Carlin remains the league’s top player and the anchor of Group 1\. He posted a dominant 4/5 score in the first season, outperforming his usual 1-kyu level. In the second season, after a rank reset to match AGA rankings, he managed to hold his top position, despite rank readjustments giving his closest rival, Leif, a two-stone handicap against him. Carlin’s steady 1-kyu ranking confirms him as the player to beat.

#### ⚫ Leif W (Go Captain)

Leif continues to be Carlin’s closest rival in G1. He scored 3 wins in the first season and matched Carlin’s modest 1/2 in the second. After the SDK rank reset in April, his ratings stood firm at a 3k strength. He’s consistently earning high Grand Prix points, confirming his solid presence near the league’s top. He also remains the club’s most consistent teacher for new Go players and Go-curious chess players. Thank you, Leif\!

#### ⚫ Joe M 

With 6/8 performances winning both the Winter and the Spring DDK competitions, Joe M has been the powerhouse of the DDK quad, with his constant willingness to play fighting games of Go proving a challenge for his competitors. This performance has seen him climb from a 12k ranking at the start of January to a 10k ranking at the end of June, putting him on the verge of breaking through into the SDK quad. Joe is one of the club’s cross-game competitors, putting in his impressive Go performances while also being a regular feature in the Chess quads. Good work, Joe\!

#### ⚫ Tommy I (Go Deputy)

Tommy had a roller coaster first half of the year. After winning just a single game in a rocky winter season beset by time troubles, he stormed back with 4 wins in the second, buoyed by a solid understanding of fundamentals and a practical Go strategy. His performance rating rose considerably, and he boosted his Grand Prix points. Though his ending rating settled around 14k, Tommy’s progress is a strong sign of development and resilience.

#### ⚫ Kaye G

Kaye is one of the league’s most active players, logging a full schedule both seasons. He performed impressively in the first season with 5 wins, including an impressive 4 win streak for all of January, then struggled a bit in the second, finishing with only 2 victories. His rating has held solid around 14k, reflecting his battling spirit and desire for growth. Kaye is always game for a fight and remains one of the DDK quad’s most dedicated competitors.

#### ⚫ Dean C

After a rocky start to the year in the SDK quad, battling against the club heavyweights Carlin and Leif, Dean dropped to the DDK quad where he has solidified himself at the top end with a 10k rating from his back to back 3/6 performances. Dean is working on adding attacking flair to his solid understanding of Go fundamentals, and is hopeful that the combination will get him back into the SDK quads by the end of the year. Dean is also one of the club’s cross-game competitors, putting in an impressive 16 Go quad games while also remaining one of the top 5 players in the club’s Chess competition.
