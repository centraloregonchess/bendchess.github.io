## Pairings & Results
See the [Google Doc][googledoc].

## What are Quads?
Our members optionally participate in our January-thru-June Quad Season.
Up-to-four players are paired into *Quads* for an **all-play-all** tournament.
Quads are **month-long events** where games are **played gradually through-out
the month** as you are able.

Playing all your games is *strongly encouraged* but can't always happen, and
Quads are designed to be flexible and account for busy lives! **Unplayed games
are scored as nil**, and inactive players are dropped to protect active-players
from inactive opponents. No harm done, **[Rule #1](#rules) is to have fun!**

Go Quads &amp; Chess Quads work slightly differently.


### Chess Quads
Quads are rank-ordered and the top Quad is called the Championship. The winner
of each Quad will get promoted to the Quad above. The last-place finisher will
get demoted to the Quad below. As players join/leave promotions & demotions may
happen differently to balance the Quads.


### Go Quads
Quads are rank-ordered and grouped according to strength, with the goal of
keeping opponent's within 9 stones of each other. All games are played with a
handicap to make the games even. If you rank-up, you will be promoted to a more
suitable Quad. Go Games naturally take longer than Chess games which presents
an extra challenge for playing all of your games. To accommodate this, **Go Quads
are played over a 3-month period, with 3 games versus each opponent** in that time.


### Super-Quads
Summer & Fall are outside of Quad-Season and are more casual. Our members compete
in low-stakes **Super-Quads**, a huge (and silly) all-play-all tournament that
lasts 3-months. These events allow the entire club to play together while
letting our members enjoy the summer and holidays without the pressure of
more-serious competitive play.


## Schedule
**Quad-Season** runs from *January-thru-June* and **decides the Club Chess & Go
Champions**. Summer & the Holidays, *July-thru-December*, are a more casual
**Off-Season & Pre-Season**. They are more relaxed, 3-month-long **Super-Quads**
that offer some fun competitive play during the hotter months. Some seriousness
returns in the Fall as **Pre-Season decides the Tie-Breaks** for the start of
next-year's **Quad-Season**!

|Schedule|Season|Grand-Prix|
|---|---|---|
|Jan-Jun|**Quad-Season**|Winter & Spring|
|Jul-Sep|**Off-Season** |Summer |
|Oct-Dec|**Pre-Season** |Holiday|


## Sign-Up/Opt-Out
Please speak to Dean at club-night if you'd like to sign-up or opt-out. There
is a sign-up (and an opt-out) form on the clip-board which should be filled in.

If you become inactive you will be dropped. If you know you'll be away - let
Dean know in advance and he can adjust pairings. You can rejoin at any time.
Just speak to Dean - in some cases we can get you onto the super-quad right away.

> We only recommend Quads to members who average at least 50% attendance.


## Tie-Breaks
When two players score the same points tie-breaks are used to decide which
player is promoted/demoted. The following tie-breaks are used in order:

1.  Head-to-head score.
2.  Games played.
3.  Previous Grand-prix.

This means that if you are paired with someone who out-performed you in the
previous Grand-Prix, you *must* out-perform them in the current Quad or lose
on tie-breaks!

> **NB.** If head-to-head score creates a "circular-tie", the previous Grand-Prix
> becomes the tie-breaker. This is a rare case, but can happen when e.g. if
> three players scored 2-0 against each other; A beats B, B beats C, C beats A.
> The players finish according to their position in the previous Grand-Prix.


## Championships
Quad-Season decides that year's Chess & Go Champions. Players compete in a
season-long race from January-thru-June by winning Championship Points. At the
end of the season, the player with the most Championship points wins the title.
(The Championship will be decided by a play-off if two-or-more players are tied
on Championship points.)

Players earn Championship points according to where the placed in their Quad
and which Quad they played in:

|Chess/Go Quad|Pos|Points|
|---|---|---|
|Championship/Dan|1st|5|
| |2nd|3|
| |3rd|2|
|Challenger/SDK|1st|3|
| |2nd|2|
| |3rd|1|
|*Any*/DDK|1st|2|
| |2nd|1|


## Grand-Prix
Each quarter Quad players compete in the Grand-Prix. At the end of the Quarter,
the player to accumulate the most Grand-Prix points over 3-months wins. (The
same tie-breaks as Quads apply.)

Grand-Prix points for each month are calculated as:

>   score + games played + check-ins

There are four Grand-Prix races each year, one for each season:

|Grand-Prix|Start|End|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Winter**|Jan|Mar|
|**Spring**|Apr|Jun|
|**Summer**|Jul|Sep|
|**Holiday**|Oct|Dec|

**You may only win one Grand-Prix per year.** Previous winners are ommited from
subsequent standings, although they still earn points for tie-break purposes.
The highest any previous winner can place in any Grand-Prix later that
year is 2nd.
