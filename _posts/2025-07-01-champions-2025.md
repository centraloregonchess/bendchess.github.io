## ♟️ Chess Champion: Blake S

Blake’s late entry in 2024 prevented him from mounting a Championship run but his strength was immediately apparent. The question at the start of 2025 was a humble one: **could *anyone* beat Blake?**
Blake wasted no time with his answer and stamped his mark on the contest with a commanding **6/6 in January**’s Championship Quad.

Throughout the season, **Daniel B** (the 2024 Champion, ) along with **Zach C** & **Joey S** all mounted their own challenges \- they surprised us all by each taking points from Blake S and turning the 2025 Championship into a thrilling race\!

Ultimately, despite the efforts of his rivals, Blake S never lost the lead in the Championship race. His best results came when they mattered most, and Blake finished the season as the new 2025 Chess Champion, showing that if he can’t win with ease then he has no-problems winning with determination & grit.

## ⚫ Go Champion: Carlin K

Carlin won the Go Championship with a convincing 2 point margin over rival (and 2024 Champion) Leif W. Carlin’s commanding 4/5 score in the Winter Quad secured an early lead and he held Leif in the Spring to secure the title. Handicap stones are used in the Go Quads to provide competitive games, so Carlin’s dominance reflects highly on Carlin’s skill in this format. Not only his strength, but his warm & generous disposition provide an example for all Club-players alike. Carlin, at 1 Kyu, remains the club’s strongest player and we’re all thrilled to see him finally win a title he has long deserved\!
