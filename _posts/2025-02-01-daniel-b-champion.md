# Daniel B is 2024's Bend Chess Champion!

After a hard fought battle between Dean C, Zach C, and Daniel B, with the lead going back and forth all year, Daniel finally clinched the Championship title by a single point. Daniel B's opening repertoire seems to prefer open-lines whatever the cost. That cost can be great but Daniel's rivals have been frustrated all-year by Daniel B's tenacity and ability to maintain tactical pressure even from *apparently* worse positions. The Quads can be a tumultuous battle-ground and Daniel B showed how attacking play & strong-nerves ultimately made this seem like a convincing and clean victory.

Congratulations to another great year of Chess & Go in Bend!

## Schedule Changes
After a particularly challenging summer due to many smoke days, the club has switched summers to purely casual play. We will continue at Crux Fermentation Project September through January, but will switch back to the Commons from June-August.

## First Swiss Tournament
After the success of the Redmond Chess Club with similar events, the club hosted their first one night swiss tournament on December 4th! Zach C won the inaugural event with a perfect 4/4, managing to swindle a dead lost position in the final game against Daniel B to clinch the victory. More one night events are being planned (potentially blitz!), both in the regular season and summer.
