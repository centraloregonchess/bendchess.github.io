# Daniel B wins the 2024 Chess Championship!

After a hard fought battle between Dean C, Zach C, and Daniel B, with the lead going back and forth all year, Dan pulled out the Club Championship by a single championship point. His enterprising play and exciting openings (the King's Gambit, mainline Najdorf, and the Benko gambit, among others, feature prominently in Dan’s repertoire) showed his class as one of the best chess players in Bend.

Congratulations to another great year of chess and go in Bend!

## Schedule Changes
After a particularly challenging summer due to many smoke days, the club has switched summers to purely casual play. We will continue at Crux Fermentation Project September through January, but will switch back to the Commons from June-August.

## First Swiss Tournament
After the success of the Redmond Chess Club with similar events, the club hosted their first one night swiss tournament on December 4th! Zach C won the inaugural event with a perfect 4/4, managing to swindle a dead lost position in the final game against Daniel B to clinch the victory. More one night events are being planned (potentially blitz!), both in the regular season and summer.
